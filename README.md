SQL and NoSQL databases

|SNo|Database|Type|Sub Type|Pros|Cons|Use Cases|Remarks|
|:---|:------:|:---|:-------|:---|:---|:--------|:------|
|1|MS SQL Server|Relational Database|
|2|Oracle|Relational Database|
|3|MongoDB|NoSQL|Document|-**Highly Scalable** - MongoDB uses the concept of sharding to scale horizontally by splitting data across multiple MongoDB instances. MongoDB can run over multiple servers, balancing the load and/or duplicating data to keep the system up and running in case of hardware failure.-**Replication** - MongoDB can provide high availability with replica sets. A replica set consists of two or more mongo DB instances. Each replica set member may act in the role of the primary or secondary replica at any time. The primary replica is the main server which interacts with the client and performs all the read/write operations. The Secondary replicas maintain a copy of the data of the primary using built-in replication. When a primary replica fails, the replica set automatically switches over to the secondary and then it becomes the primary server.-**Flexible schema**|1. Not strongly ACID Compliant. 2. No function or SP exists where you can bind the logic. 3. Not good for highly transactional systems.|E-Commerce website - Product Catalog Management|**Collection** corresponds to a table. -**Document** corresponds to a row in the collection. -**Fields** are analogous to columns in relational databases.|
|4|Cassandra|NoSQL|Column Oriented|-Highly available by design. -Can be globally distributed. -Allows applications to write to any node anywhere, anytime. -Linearly scalable by simply adding more nodes to the cluster. -Automatic workload and data balancing. -A query language that looks a lot like SQL.|Performance is unpredictable, as all the background task are executed in random way and are not scheduled by users. -Here data is modelled around queries instead of its structure due to which same data is store multiple times. -To store huge amount of data, JVM is required to manage the memory which itself is a language, and so garbage collection is not done by application but by a language in Cassandra. |Writes exceed reads by a large margin. -Data is rarely updated and when updates are made they are idempotent. -Read Access is by a known primary key. -Data can be partitioned via a key that allows the database to be spread evenly across multiple nodes. -There is no need for joins or aggregates. -Example - Transaction logging, Storing health tracker data.|**Cluster**: It is a complete set of multiple data centers on which the entire data is stored for processing in the Cassandra NoSQL database. **Data center**: A set of related nodes are grouped in a data center. **Node**: The specific place where the data resides on the cluster is called a node. **Commit log**: It is a failsafe method that is deployed by Cassandra in order to take a backup of all data in the Cassandra database by writing it to the commit log. **Memtable**: It is a data structure that resides in the memory where Cassandra buffers writes. There will be one active Memtable per table. **SSTable**: When Memtables reach their threshold value, they are flushed onto the disk, and they become immutable SSTables. **Bloom filter**: The bloom filter is an algorithm that lets you test whether an element is a member of a set in a swift manner. These bloom filters are accessed after each query.|
